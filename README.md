# FlashGuides - Angular Version

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## What's this project for anyway?
This project contains code for a desktop web application for my 2018 Capstone project at Sheridan College's Software Development and Network Engineering Program. This project was not used for the Capstone and is instead an expansion on the project done by me as a way to further develop my programming skills while continuing off the work I already did. We originally made a simple website with Javascript hosted on google's servers as a way to display guides. This project will not only do that but become more fully functional; the ultimate goal is to have a fully functional web app where users can view and manage their favorite guides

## Project Description
The project was a mobile application that focuses on creating quick how-to guides on an Android phone. Users are able to create an account and from there create a guide on anything they want. They can save guides and return to editing them later, or publish them for others to view.

We use Google Firebase for our back-end, storing all user information and guide data (text and images). On the mobile app we also have a small search functionality that allows users to search for published guides by either looking up words in the title, or by user.

## Current Goals
Right now, I am currently working to get guides displayed on screen just as they were on the web site.

## Next Steps
The next thing to do would be to allow users to favorite and save guides so they don't have to search the ones they want every time. In addition, a full-text search feature for the web app similar to our mobile app will also be implemented.
